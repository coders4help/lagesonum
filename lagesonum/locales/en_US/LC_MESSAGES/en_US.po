"This website was created by volunteers. Its purpose is for people applying for asylum that are currently not at LaGeSo to be able to check if their waiting number was already been called. There are mobile registration teams coming to the shelters, but the process is very slow and not transparent enough for the people with waiting numbers. Some people have to wait up to 15 days until teams arrive. This leads to people distrusting the system and also gives everyone the feeling that they are missing something. Unfortunately, it has also happened that people from the official shelters were sent back to LaGeSo the next morning, whether they had a waiting number or not.\n"
"We hope this website will aid in making the whole waiting number process more transparent.\n"
"People with waiting numbers, please send us feedback, what information you are missing and we will do our best to make it available to you!"
