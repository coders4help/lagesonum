msgid "about_par1"
msgstr "This website was created by volunteers. Its purpose is for people applying for asylum that are currently not at LaGeSo to be able to check if their waiting number has already been called. The registration process for people in shelters is intransparent and constantly changing without people being properly informed. There have been some mobile registration teams, there have been shuttle services to LaGeSo and in all cases there hast been a lot of idling and waiting and not being informed. Having to wait for weeks leads to people distrusting the system and also gives everyone the feeling that they are missing something. That's why they are walking back to LaGeSo and spending their nights homeless, which is a bad situation giving the falling temperatures and crimes."
