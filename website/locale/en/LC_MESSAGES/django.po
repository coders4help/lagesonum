"This website was created by volunteers. Its purpose is for people applying "
"for asylum that are currently not at LaGeSo to be able to check if their "
"waiting number has already been called. The registration process for people "
"in shelters is intransparent and constantly changing without people being "
"properly informed. There have been some mobile registration teams, there "
"have been shuttle services to LaGeSo and in all cases there hast been a lot "
"of idling and waiting and not being informed. Having to wait for weeks leads "
"to people distrusting the system and also gives everyone the feeling that "
"they are missing something. That's why they are walking back to LaGeSo and "
"spending their nights homeless, which is a bad situation giving the falling "
"temperatures and crimes."
